# Mobile Offloading

This project, developed using Android Studio, utilizes two or more mobile phones to be
connected through Bluetooth and can share
information such as battery levels, the distance between
master and slave, the location of the phones, and computational
data. Out of these mobile devices, one acts as a Master, and
the other(s) act as a Slave device(s). 

# Tasks Performed:
  1. Information sharing (battery levels, distance between master and slave, location)
  2. Compute matrix multiplication.
  3. Distributed computation.
  4. Execution time and power consumption.
